# What's That Chord Doing?

This is an ear-training app for intermediate musicians&#8212;maybe roughly sophomore-level musicianship students, in college.


Project directory structure and build system derived from the [Thinkful React starter kit](https://github.com/oampo/thinkful-react-starter).

### Working on OR trying the project:

* Run the client: `npm run dev`
    * Serves our client at http://localhost:8080 (try it out in your browser)
    * Automatically rebuilds when files in our build change

* Run the API server (optional):
  1. `mongod&` to open the mongo daemon
  2. `node api/server.js` to start the server
    * Starts server running at http://localhost:8081

----------------------------------------------------------

### Rational

Hearing chords in the context of a key is a crucial musical skill. Every ear training app ignores this and instead has us identify chords outside a contextâ€”by "character," instead of function.

### Description

This is an app for musical intermediates that want to start transcribing or get better at playing by ear.
