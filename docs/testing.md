# [![What's That Chord Doing?](img/logo.png)](http://what-s-that-chord-doing.herokuapp.com)

Our [backend tests](../test-server/README.md) are done with Mocha/Chai.

Our front-end tests are primarily snapshot-based, and are a mix of 
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and 
[Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme), and accompanying fake-renderers
and DOM fakers.

We [test our React components](../js/components/__tests__/README.md) and Redux 
reducers.
