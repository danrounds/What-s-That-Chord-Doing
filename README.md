# What's That Chord Doing?

This is an ear-training app for intermediate musicians&#8212;maybe roughly sophomore-level musicianship students, in college.


Project directory structure and build system derived from the [Thinkful React starter kit](https://github.com/oampo/thinkful-react-starter).

### Working on OR trying out the project:

* Run the development task: `npm run dev`
    * Starts a server running at http://localhost:8080
    * Automatically rebuilds when any of your files change

----------------------------------------------------------

### Rational

Hearing chords in the context of a key is a crucial musical skill. Every ear training app ignores this and instead has us identify chords outside a contextâ€”by "character," instead of function.

### Description

This is an app for musical intermediates that want to start transcribing or get better at playing by ear.
